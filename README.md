# PrettyGirlsPodcast
Podcast Website
This  web application is to log podcast information.  Specifically the Podcast Name, Description, Host, and date podcasted.
It also lists different Hosts with each hosts accompanying information and the podcasts that they have hosted . In the near
future I going to add metadata for link to actual recordings of the actual podcast, the ability to become a member and submit
suggestions and apply to be a host.
